# Research
### The application of quantitative methods in ecology and conservation is the principal driver for my dissertation research. I develop hierarchical models to parse out the complexities of ecological systems into processes that can be described using multi-level statistical and mathematical models. I utilize the flexibility of a Bayesian statistical framework and rigorous computer programming to implement hierarchical models. The estimates from these models inform wildlife management, and the model development provides a quantitative framework for future ecological and conservation research.
