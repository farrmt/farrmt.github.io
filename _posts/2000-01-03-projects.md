### Hierarchical Community Distance Sampling<br>
### for a carnivore community:<br>
#### A case study in the Masai Mara, Kenya

I am working with the [David Green](http://inr.oregonstate.edu/people/david-green) and the [Holekamp lab](http://www.holekamplab.org/) to quantify the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the carnivore community with in Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Carnivore communities in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, including the MMNR, are among the most diverse in the world, but human-wildlife conflict threatens the continuation of this community. To understand the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the
carnivore community, we compare two disparate management regions within the MMNR. The Mara Triangle experiences minimal disturbance while the Narok region contains high frequency of human-wildlife conflict. Using a HCDS model we estimate the community wide and species-specific effects of the Narok region on carnivore abundance and compared speciesâ€™ densities between regions.

### Orangutan population dispersion and habitat shifts<br>
### in a heterogeneous natural landscape

I am currently collaborating on a project with [Andy Marshall](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/ajmarsha/) and [Lydia Beaudrot](http://lydiabeaudrot.weebly.com/) looking at the abiotic and biotic factors effecting the distribution of the Bornean Orangutan.

### Reconciling discrepancies in data using an<br>
### integrated population model:<br>
#### A case study of the American woodcock

The Zipkin lab is collaborating with [Todd Arnold](https://fwcb.cfans.umn.edu/personnel/todd-arnold) to use an integrated population model (IPM) to estimate population size and vital rates of the American woodcock using harvest data and band recovery data. The harvest data and band recovery data disagree when using separate population and band recovery models. The IPM framework integrates data from both sources of data simultaneously and reconciles their differences.
