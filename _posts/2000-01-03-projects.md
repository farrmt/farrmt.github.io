I am working with [David Green](http://inr.oregonstate.edu/people/david-green) and the [Holekamp lab](http://www.holekamplab.org/) to quantify the impact of anthropogenic disturbance and management alternatives on the carnivore community within the Masai Mara National Reserve (MMNR), Kenya. Carnivore communities in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, including the MMNR, are among the most diverse in the world, but human-wildlife conflict threatens the continuation of this community. To understand the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the carnivore community, we compare two disparate management regions within the MMNR that are managed by separate entities. The Mara Triangle experiences minimal disturbance while the Talek region contains high frequency of human-wildlife conflict. Using a hierarchical multi-species distance sampling model we estimate the community wide and species-specific effects of the Talek region on carnivore abundance and compared speciesâ€™ densities between regions.

I am currently collaborating on a project with [Andy Marshall](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/ajmarsha/) and [Lydia Beaudrot](http://lydiabeaudrot.weebly.com/) looking at the abiotic and biotic factors affecting the distribution of the Bornean Orangutan.

The Zipkin lab is collaborating with [Todd Arnold](https://fwcb.cfans.umn.edu/personnel/todd-arnold) to use an integrated population model (IPM) to estimate population size and vital rates of the American woodcock using harvest data and band recovery data. The harvest data and band recovery data disagree when using separate population and band recovery models. The IPM framework integrates data from both sources of data simultaneously and reconciles their differences.
